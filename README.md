# kmeans_clustering
In this repository I have implemented segmentation of customers based on their spending scores and annual income using k-means clustering algorithm
The dataset consists of 200 data point
The original dataset has information about the gender and age as well but I have not used them for the purpose of classification
The number of clusters is identified using WCSS.
